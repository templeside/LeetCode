    for my intuition, I think I am goind to use sliding window because I need to move forward and shrink as much I have the amount of t's characters. so that I can get the O(N).
           
having the hashmap to count the characters are matched with t.
I would shrink it out when having the full match with the t's characters to avoid matching.

    ex) s= "ADOBECODEB A  N  C", t = "ABC"
            012345678910,11,12
windowStart  ^
windowEnd        ^
p_counter = [A:0, B:0,C:0]
matched = 3;
the output = ADOBEC;

what is the criteria to shrink the window size?????
